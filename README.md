# Sidcup-Family-Golf-Clone

I have created an exact replica of a website  Sidcup Family Golf -> [https://sidcupfamilygolf.com/] using the following technologies:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
Swiper JS

The primary goal of this project was to learn how animated websites are created.
Through this exercise, I have gained a deeper understanding of web animations, interactivity, and user experience design.
