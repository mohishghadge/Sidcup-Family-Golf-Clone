# Sidcup-Family-Golf-Clone
📑I have created an exact replica of a website  Sidcup Family Golf -> [https://sidcupfamilygolf.com/] using the following technologies:    
                                                                                                                                         
👩‍💻Tech Stack :                                                                                                                                
              1.HTML,                                                                                                                      
              2.CSS,                                                                                                                     
              3.JavaScript,                                                                                                               
              4.GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform),                                                                                        
              5.Swiper JS                      
                                                                                                                                               
🎯The primary goal of this project was to learn how animated websites are created.                                                     
   Through this exercise, I have gained a deeper understanding of web animations, interactivity, and user experience design.
